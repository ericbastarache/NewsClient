## Build Instructions

1. Ensure you have angular-cli & electron installed globally. If you need to install it, run `npm install -g @angular/cli` and `npm install -g electron`.
2. Clone this repo to your local machine.
3. `cd` into the repo and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Create a `.env` file with the following contents:
```
PACKAGE=true
HOST=localhost:4200
```
5. Run `npm start` to build and run the project with Electron.

## Installation

You can find the installation file available for download from my [portfolio](http://ericbastarache.github.io/#portfolio) at the bottom (sorry!). Currently it is only available for Mac with a Windows installer hopefully coming in the near future.
